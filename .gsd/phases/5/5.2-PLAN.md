# Plan 5.2: Integrate PCViewer into Pages

<objective>
Replace the static placeholder divs on the /build page and homepage with the interactive PCViewer component.

Purpose: Make the 3D viewer visible and functional in the actual application.
Output: PCViewer rendered on /build and / pages.
</objective>

<context>
Load for context:
- src/components/viewer/PCViewer.tsx (from Plan 5.1)
- src/app/build/page.tsx
- src/app/page.tsx
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Replace Build Page Placeholder with PCViewer</name>
  <files>src/app/build/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    1. Import `PCViewer` from `@/components/viewer/PCViewer`.
    2. Find the 3D Viewer Placeholder div (the one with `[Interactive 3D Viewer Area]` text and the Monitor icon).
    3. Replace it entirely with:
       ```tsx
       <PCViewer className="w-full h-[400px] rounded-xl overflow-hidden border border-zinc-800" />
       ```
    4. Remove the `Monitor` import from lucide-react if it's no longer used elsewhere in the file.

    AVOID: Wrapping PCViewer in another container with background color — the Canvas is transparent and the dark page background shows through.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build</verify>
  <done>The /build page renders the interactive 3D PC model instead of the placeholder text.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Replace Homepage Placeholder with PCViewer</name>
  <files>src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    1. Add `'use client'` directive at the top (needed for R3F Canvas).
    2. Import `PCViewer` from `@/components/viewer/PCViewer`.
    3. Find the "How It Works" section placeholder (the div with `[3D PC View Placeholder]` text).
    4. Replace the placeholder content with:
       ```tsx
       <PCViewer className="w-full h-full" />
       ```
    5. Keep the parent container's styling (aspect-square, rounded-2xl, overflow-hidden, border).

    AVOID: Removing the metadata export if it exists — move it to a separate `layout.tsx` or just remove since layout.tsx already has metadata.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build</verify>
  <done>The homepage "How It Works" section shows the interactive 3D model instead of a grey placeholder.</done>
</task>
