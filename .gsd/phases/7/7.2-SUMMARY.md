# Plan 7.2 Execution Summary

**Wave 2 | Plan 7.2: Enhanced Compatibility Engine**

## Actions Taken
- [x] Updated `ComponentItem` type in `src/app/build/page.tsx` to include all new spec fields (socket, ddrGeneration, tdp, recommendedPsu, length, maxGpuLength, etc.).
- [x] Deleted hardcoded string matching logic for DDR and high-end GPUs in `compatibilityWarnings`.
- [x] Implemented proper `ddrGeneration` check comparing CPU requirement with selected RAM.
- [x] Implemented PSU wattage check against explicitly defined GPU `recommendedPsu`.
- [x] Implemented case clearance check comparing GPU `length` vs Case `maxGpuLength`.
- [x] Implemented total system TDP calculation (CPU.tdp + GPU.tdp + 50W base) warning if it exceeds 85% of PSU wattage.
- [x] Verified build passes and TypeScript types match the new JSON schema.

## Goal Verified
> Compatibility checker uses spec fields instead of string matching. Warnings show actual values.

## Next Steps
Verify phase 7 completion against the ROADMAP must-haves.
