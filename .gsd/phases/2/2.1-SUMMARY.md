# Plan 2.1: Migrate Static Pages - Execution Summary

## Tasks Completed
- Refactored `legacy/index.html` into `src/app/page.tsx`. Recreated the Hero section, the three "Why Choose Us" features, and the "How It Works" instructions.
- Refactored `legacy/about.html` into `src/app/about/page.tsx` utilizing shadcn `Card` UI components.
- Refactored `legacy/contact.html` into `src/app/contact/page.tsx` with a static UI form representation.
- All styles correspond to the strict dark tech minimalistic theme with `oklch` scale variables.
- Installed `lucide-react` for icon consistency, replacing bootstrap icons.

## Next Step Dependencies
- The static pages are now in place; routing adjustments for the Navbar/Footer (Plan 2.2) will make them accessible.
