# Plan 2.2: Setup Configurations Page & Routing - Execution Summary

## Tasks Completed
- Scaffolded `src/app/configs/page.tsx` with a responsive empty-state design matching the dark theme, using the `Monitor` icon from `lucide-react`.
- Verified navigation routing in `src/components/layout/navbar.tsx` and `src/components/layout/footer.tsx`.
- All `href` tags correctly map to `/`, `/build`, `/configs`, `/about`, and `/contact`.

## Next Step Dependencies
- The static UI layout is now completely established. Subsequent phases will integrate the configuration engine (interactive components) in Phase 3.
