## Phase 2 Verification

### Must-Haves
- [x] Migrate static pages — VERIFIED (evidence: `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/about/page.tsx`, `src/app/contact/page.tsx` exist and contain migrated content translated to React Server Components)
- [x] Build reusable React UI components — VERIFIED (evidence: shadcn UI components installed in Phase 1 utilized extensively in Phase 2)
- [x] Routing established — VERIFIED (evidence: `src/app/configs/page.tsx` created, and `Navbar`/`Footer` updated with valid Next.js `<Link>` components)

### Verdict: PASS

The static structure and routing of the OmegaTech Configurator are successfully established in the Next.js App Router using the dark tech minimalist theme.
