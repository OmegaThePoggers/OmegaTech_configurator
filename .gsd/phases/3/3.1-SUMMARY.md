# Plan 3.1: Upgrade Component Data Model - Execution Summary

## Tasks Completed
- Created the `src/data` directory for Next.js internal data assets.
- Relocated and modified `pc-components.json` into `src/data/pc-components.json`.
- Implemented the `purchaseLinks` array model for every component across all categories (CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage, PSU, Case).
- Each component now possesses placeholder `#` URL strings for `Amazon`, `Flipkart`, and `MD Computers`.
- Deleted the original `pc-components.json` at the project root to enforce single source of truth.

## Deviations Applied
None — executed as planned.

## Next Step Dependencies
- The React components built in Plan 3.2 and 3.3 will import the data from `src/data/pc-components.json`.
