# Plan 3.3: Implement Configurator State & Logic - Execution Summary

## Tasks Completed
- Refactored `src/app/build/page.tsx` entirely into a React Client Component using `'use client'`.
- Imported `src/data/pc-components.json` to hydrate the `<select>` options dynamically with store/price data mapping.
- Implemented `useState` for tracking the `selectedComponents`.
- Implemented `useMemo` hooks for automated, real-time recalculation of:
  - `totalCost`: summing the `.price` of selected categories.
  - `compatibilityWarnings`: checking for DDR4/DDR5 mismatches (13th Gen/AM5 checks) and verifying PSU wattage (750W+) constraints against high-end GPUs.
  - `performanceScore`: applying the 0-100 logic porting the legacy scores for CPU tiers and GPU tiers.
- Wired up the "Clear" and "Randomize" buttons inside the summary sidebar configuration grid.

## Deviations Applied
None — executed as planned.

## Next Step Dependencies
- The Configurator Logic is now fully ported over and natively functional inside the new React environment. Phase 3 execution is complete. Proceeding to verify the Phase 3 goal before Phase 4 (3D Viewer) planning.
