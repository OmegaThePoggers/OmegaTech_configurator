# Plan 3.1: Upgrade Component Data Model

## Objective
Update the `pc-components.json` structure to include dummy product links for Amazon, Flipkart, and MD Computers as specified in the requirements. Move this file to the `src/data` directory for Next.js imports.

## Context
- .gsd/SPEC.md
- pc-components.json

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Relocate and Upgrade Component JSON</name>
  <files>src/data/pc-components.json, pc-components.json</files>
  <action>
    - Create `src/data` directory.
    - Move `pc-components.json` to `src/data/pc-components.json`.
    - Modify the JSON structure so each component has an array of `purchaseLinks`.
    - Each purchase link should have a `store` name ("Amazon", "Flipkart", or "MD Computers") and a placeholder `url` ("#").
    - Ensure price properties remain intact.
  </action>
  <verify>cat src/data/pc-components.json | grep purchaseLinks</verify>
  <done>The JSON file includes the new structure with store links mapped correctly.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `src/data/pc-components.json` exists.
- [ ] Every component inside the JSON has 3 placeholder store links.
- [ ] The original `pc-components.json` file in the root is deleted to prevent confusion.
