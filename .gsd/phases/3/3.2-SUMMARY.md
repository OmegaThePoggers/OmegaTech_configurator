# Plan 3.2: Build Configurator UI Shell - Execution Summary

## Tasks Completed
- Scaffolded `src/app/build/page.tsx`, translating the legacy Bootstrap structure from `legacy/configurator.php` into a responsive Tailwind CSS grid.
- Left column (Component Selection/Viewer) features static UI native `<select>` dropdowns for CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage, PSU, and Case.
- Right Column (Summary sidebar) features an initialized 0 price total and empty selection fields awaiting state synchronization.
- All styling leverages `shadcn`'s standard dark mode variables.

## Deviations Applied
None — executed as planned.

## Next Step Dependencies
- The UI is visually ready but non-functional. The next plan (3.3) will hook the dropdowns into React State using `pc-components.json`, enabling real-time cost / compatibility logic.
