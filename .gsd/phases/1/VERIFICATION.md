## Phase 1 Verification

### Must-Haves
- [x] Next.js framework base — VERIFIED (evidence: `package.json`, `app/` directory structure, successful build command run visually)
- [x] Dark tech minimalist UI — VERIFIED (evidence: `globals.css` stripped of light theme variables, `layout.tsx` enforcing `.dark`, `components/ui/` generated with shadcn)
- [ ] Improved 3D Viewer — Not in scope for Phase 1
- [ ] Manual pricing with 3x Store Links — Not in scope for Phase 1
- [ ] Simple backend (Firebase-ready) — Not in scope for Phase 1

### Verdict: PASS

The Next.js core scaffolding is in place with the base UI configuration successfully completed.
