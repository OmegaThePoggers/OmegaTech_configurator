# Plan 6.2: UI Polish & Content

<objective>
Finalize the About and Contact pages with real content and styled forms. Polish any remaining placeholder content across the site.

Purpose: Complete the final 10% of UI polish to make the site feel like a finished product for the deliverable.
Output: Polished About and Contact pages.
</objective>

<context>
Load for context:
- src/app/about/page.tsx
- src/app/contact/page.tsx
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Polish About Page</name>
  <files>src/app/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Update the About page with real content:
    1. A hero section with "About OmegaTech" heading.
    2. A short paragraph about the configurator's purpose (helping users build custom PCs with compatibility checks, transparent pricing, and store comparisons).
    3. A "Our Mission" section about making PC building accessible.
    4. A "Tech Stack" section listing: Next.js, React, Three.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
    5. Use the existing Card components for layout consistency.

    AVOID: Lorem ipsum or filler text. Write real, concise content.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "OmegaTech" src/app/about/page.tsx</verify>
  <done>About page has real content, mission statement, and tech stack section.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Polish Contact Page</name>
  <files>src/app/contact/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Update the Contact page with a styled form:
    1. "Get In Touch" heading.
    2. A form with: Name, Email, Subject, and Message fields.
    3. All fields use styled inputs matching the dark zinc theme (bg-zinc-950, border-zinc-700, text-zinc-200).
    4. A "Send Message" submit button (non-functional — just UI for deliverable).
    5. Below the form, add contact info: email, GitHub link.

    AVOID: Making the form functional (no API route needed). This is a deliverable showcase.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "Send Message" src/app/contact/page.tsx</verify>
  <done>Contact page has a styled form with Name, Email, Subject, Message fields and a Send button.</done>
