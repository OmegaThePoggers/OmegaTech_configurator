# Plan 4.2: Shopping Cart System - Execution Summary

## Tasks Completed
- Created `src/context/CartContext.tsx` with add/remove/clear/isInCart functions and computed totals.
- Created `src/components/providers.tsx` as a 'use client' wrapper to keep `layout.tsx` as a server component.
- Wrapped app children in `<Providers>` inside `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- Rewrote `src/components/layout/navbar.tsx` as 'use client' with a ShoppingCart icon and live badge count from CartContext.
- Created `src/app/cart/page.tsx` with item list, remove/clear buttons, total price, and empty state.
- Updated `src/app/components/page.tsx` to wire "Add to Cart" buttons using `addItem()` with "In Cart ✓" visual feedback.

## Deviations Applied
None — executed as planned.
