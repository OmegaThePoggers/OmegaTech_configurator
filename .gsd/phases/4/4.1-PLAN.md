# Plan 4.1: Browse Components Page with Filtering

<objective>
Create a dedicated `/components` page that displays all PC components from the JSON data in a card grid, with a sidebar containing filters for category, brand, price range, and sort order.

Purpose: Provides a classic e-commerce browsing experience and demonstrates a filtering system for the project deliverables.
Output: A fully functional browse page at `/components` with real-time client-side filtering.
</objective>

<context>
Load for context:
- src/data/pc-components.json
- src/app/build/page.tsx (reference for component types and data import pattern)
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create Browse Components Page with Filter Sidebar</name>
  <files>src/app/components/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create a 'use client' page at `src/app/components/page.tsx`.
    
    **Layout:** Two-column responsive grid:
    - Left sidebar (1/4 width on desktop, full-width collapsible on mobile): filter controls.
    - Right main area (3/4 width): card grid of components.
    
    **Filters (all client-side using useState + useMemo):**
    1. **Category checkboxes**: CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage, PSU, Case. Multiple can be selected. Default: all selected.
    2. **Brand radio buttons**: Parse unique brands from component names (e.g., "Intel", "AMD", "NVIDIA", "Corsair", "Samsung", etc.). Include an "All" option as default.
    3. **Price Range**: Two number inputs (Min, Max) with a default range covering all items (₹0 — ₹100,000).
    4. **Sort dropdown**: "Price: Low → High", "Price: High → Low", "Name: A → Z".
    
    **Result Grid:**
    - Display filtered components in a responsive card grid (2 cols on md, 3 cols on lg).
    - Each card shows: component name, category badge, price formatted as ₹XX,XXX, and an "Add to Cart" button (non-functional placeholder for now).
    - Show a count: "Showing X of Y components".
    - If no results match filters, display an empty state message.
    
    **Data:** Import `pc-components.json`. Flatten all categories into a single array with each item tagged by its category string for filtering.
    
    AVOID: Using `defaultValue` on select elements — use controlled `value` + `onChange`. Use shadcn Card components for the grid items.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build</verify>
  <done>The /components route renders a filterable, sortable grid of all 30 PC components. Selecting "CPU" checkbox shows only CPUs. Setting price max to 20000 hides expensive items. Sort by price works correctly.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add Components Link to Navbar</name>
  <files>src/components/layout/navbar.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Add a "Components" navigation link in the Navbar between "Build PC" and "Saved Configs", pointing to `/components`.
    Keep the same styling as other nav links (text-sm font-medium text-zinc-400 hover:text-zinc-50).
  </action>
  <verify>grep "components" src/components/layout/navbar.tsx</verify>
  <done>Navbar shows a "Components" link that navigates to /components.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

After all tasks, verify:
- [ ] /components page loads and displays all 30 items
- [ ] Category filter works (checking CPU shows only CPUs)
- [ ] Brand filter works (selecting Intel shows only Intel items)
- [ ] Price range filter works
- [ ] Sort order changes item ordering
- [ ] Navbar includes Components link
